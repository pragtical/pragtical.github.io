This is a **SCALE bug fix** release! Release explanation slightly adapted from
[#152](https://github.com/pragtical/pragtical/pull/152)

Since new renwindow api (that allows initializing windows directly in Lua) the
main window creation was moved to core.init but, the scale detection code was
still been performed before. This meant that loading the default system style
was using the incorrect scale causing issues that would only be resolved by
manually re-scaling the interface.

Previously, tried to wrongly fix the issue by delegating the responsibility to
the scale plugin but that wasn't the correct solution (didn't notice what
explained on first paragraph until later ðŸ˜“). Now we defer style loading until
main window is created and the default system scale properly detected, this
ensures that the correct scale is set before performing any style calculations
that rely on it.

Now besides updating scale on the displaychanged event it also updates it when
the window is resized, but we limited the amount of scale checks on resize to
prevent crashes on X11.

Hopefully these changes finally tackle the scale issues ðŸ˜„
