This quick minor release introduces some more enhancements and fixes for
annoyances found while testing other stuff, most of them are triggered in some
edge cases but still, they were causing an itch ðŸ˜„

Some nice additions are: better restoration of window size on startup which
was causing me headaches on wayland, support for autocompletion of preprocessor
symbols on C/C++ and fallback detection of UTF-16/32 when no encoding was detected.
