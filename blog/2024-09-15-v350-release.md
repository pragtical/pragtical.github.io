A new week and a new release with fixes and performance improvements!

Over the past few days, various people have helped by reporting issues on the GitHub
[issue tracker](https://github.com/pragtical/pragtical/issues), and this release
tackles some of them. One prominent change is the improvement in the way that
coroutines are scheduled, resulting in overall better responsiveness and
performance of the editor, an improvement that would not have been possible
without the testing of [AmerM137](https://github.com/AmerM137).

Also, while working on a not-yet-finished C++ native tokenizer (to see if we gain
some better performance), I found that the `utf8.len` function accepts a
`lax` parameter that allows calculating the length of the string without
checking if it is invalid UTF-8 (we don't need this check since we are passing
clean UTF-8 text to the tokenizer). Using this flag on the Lua tokenizer calls of
`ulen` gives us over a 75% time reduction in the per-line tokenization process.

Another area that has seen improvements is in the startup and memory usage
departments. We changed how the settings plugin deals with the global status
of the scrollbar to not depend on a coroutine. In the memory department, we
modified various core plugins that make use of weak document table keys to
clear the content of these tables immediately after a document is closed. This
change should result in the garbage collector kicking in sooner for cleanup
of unused memory.

This release also introduces AppImage and Portable `ARM64 Linux builds` of the
editor for people working on those platforms, as suggested by
[jvoisin](https://github.com/jvoisin).

For plugin developers, we introduced two new functions to deal with ignore
files: `core.get_ignore_file_rules()` and `common.match_ignore_rule(path, info, ignore_rules)`.
Also, the editor version was aligned with the mod version, meaning that they
are now the same.

Some other changes include:

* Proper updates to the NoteBook widget on tab change.
* Better DPI runtime awareness on Windows (special thanks to
  [LeDominik](https://github.com/LeDominik), who performed macOS scale testing
  on previous releases, resulting in today's improvements).
* Fixes to the regex C API that allow it to work properly on macOS ARM64
  (reported by [dilpreetsio](https://github.com/dilpreetsio)).
* Better borderless behavior when clicking window action buttons.
* Fixes to window size restoration on startup.
* Improvements to the findfile and projectsearch plugins in handling
  ignore files.

A big THANK YOU to everyone who reports issues!
