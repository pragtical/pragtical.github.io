Mostly a bugs fix release with build system adjustments and a tiny bit of
enhancements sprinkled on the top.

## Prominent Fixes

Some of the fixes include a correction to the dirmonitor backend detection
logic thanks to [TomaSajt](https://github.com/TomaSajt). Also, the code
indentation logic was wrong on some instances and should behave better now
thanks to [Sentmoraap](https://github.com/Sentmoraap).

<!-- truncate -->

A bug on the tokenizer was fixed to prevent the premature end of child subsyntaxes.
As a consequence, the python language syntax should behave better now, also
this syntax saw some more adjustments. On the newly introduced Diff Viewer the
gap differences between the two sides was not been accounted on scroll which
caused out of sync scrolling, should be fixed now thanks to
[bananakid](https://github.com/bananakid) who reported the issue.

Some other enhancements and fixes thanks to [Amer](https://github.com/AmerM137)
which includes the window title now including the current project, some
documentation clarifications on the initial user module related to ignore
file patterns and proper sizing of the project search find text widget.
