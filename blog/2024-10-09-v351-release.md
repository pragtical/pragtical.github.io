A patch release that includes some nice fixes and additions!

In the past, the code responsible for file system monitoring automatically
unwatched/watched files when an event was received. This behavior was disabled
because it caused indefinite signaling of events, which increased CPU usage in
the autoreload plugin that needs to monitor files independently. However, this
behavior is actually necessary for backends like inotify, where a file would get
automatically unwatched if it was removed, only to be re-added later. One
example of this occurs when performing a `git checkout <branch>`, which removes
and re-adds files that contain changes, causing a file to be unwatched by inotify.
This release restores the previous behavior and fixes the endless signaling of
file system events, resulting in a better functioning autoreload plugin.

:::note
The unwatched/watched behavior wouldn't be necessary if the DirMonitor
implementation also reported the type of event, such as deletion, addition,
modification, etc. However, until that is implemented (if it ever is), we will
continue to re-watch on file system monitoring backends that may require it.

In the scaling random wars, we now keep the `DEFAULT_SCALE` always updated,
even if auto-detection of scaling is disabled. This ensures that when enabling
auto-detection on a running editor instance, it will use the correct system
scale. Additionally, for Linux users, we have added code to prefer the Wayland
video backend by default if the system is running on Wayland. This should result
in crisper output on non-native scales, while the Xwayland backend may lead to
blurry rendering.

In the Windows frontend, we added a `pragtical.com` wrapper around
`pragtical.exe`, which is compiled in console mode. This enhancement improves
the experience of using the editor's CLI interface from CMD or PowerShell, as
these environments prioritize `.com` binaries over `.exe` files:

<video autoplay muted loop style={{width: '100%'}} controls>
  <source src="/videos/blog/3.5.1/pragtical-com-windows.mp4"/>
</video>

Other changes include:

* Making the latency reduction feature toggleable (in case you want to reduce
  some CPU usage).
* Fixes to the JavaScript syntax embedded HTML support (which was matching
  elements that weren't embedded HTML).
* Plus other fixes and changes...
