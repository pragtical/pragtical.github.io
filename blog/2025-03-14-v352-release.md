Some fixes, build system corrections, and some new features!

This release consists mostly of fixes with some minor new additions. One
of the relevant changes is proper handling of BOM on opened documents with
a new status bar indicator, which lets you know if the current document has a
BOM as shown on the screenshot:

<!-- truncate -->

Another notable change is the addition of an `Advanced` settings pane that lets
you modify the garbage collector behaviour. Modifying these values lets you
choose between a more responsive text editor or a more memory efficient one:

Also, more syntax annotation types where added in order to offer more
flexibility when providing doc comments highlighting support on language files.
This is the case of `language_php` which is now making use of them:

Finally, this release incorporates various upstream changes, the most notable
of them being tab stops support!
