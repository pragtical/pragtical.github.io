This is an emergency release that fixes a bug on the TreeView plugin
sizing calculation. The bug caused a constant calculation of the TreeView
width when performing the move_towards animation, ending in high cpu usage.

This release also makes some changes to the JIT initialization flags
to make it perform more predictably while hopefully reducing trace flushes,
which was caused by wrong usage of previous flags. The new configuration
was benchmarked several times with good results.
