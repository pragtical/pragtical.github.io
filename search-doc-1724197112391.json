The program name and its arguments need not be escaped as the API does it when necessary.  Since v2.1.0, users can provide a string instead of a table as the first argument to prevent the function from escaping them. This may help with legacy software on Windows such as cmd.exe. However, this should not be done on POSIX platforms as the entire string will be treated as the program name and cause issues.  Before v2.1.0, this table is not escaped on Windows.  The second argument specifies options to control process creation.  timeout is an advisory value that will be used by process:wait() and is optional.  cwd is the current working directory of the program. If specified, the child process would run as if it was started in the directory.  stdin, stdout and stderr tells Pragtical how to treat standard input and output of the child process. There are four possible values:  process.REDIRECT_DEFAULT is the default behavior. It will be deprecated in future versions as specifying nil is preferred.process.REDIRECT_PIPE allows the Process API to write/read the input/output of the child process.process.REDIRECT_PARENT redirects the child process' input/output to the parent. If stdin has this value, child process will accept input from the parent process' console. If stdout or stderr has this value, child process will output to the parent process' console.process.REDIRECT_DISCARD discards any data to/from child process.process.REDIRECT_STDOUT can only be used on stderr and will redirect the child process' standard error to its standard output.  env is a table containing the environment variables for the child process as key-value pairs.  note On POSIX platforms, this table will extend the parent's environment. On Windows, this table will replace the parent's environment. In the future, this inconsistency may be fixed.  The function returns a Process object that the user should hold onto until the child process can be safely terminated. If the Process object is garbage-collected, the child process will be killed.

To insert a literal dollar sign ($), use $$.  Other than that, \\U and \\L can be used to toggle uppercase or lowercase, while \\u and \\l causes the next character to be in uppercase or lowercase.  Example:  local s = &quot;John Doe, Jane Doe, Peter Doe&quot; local r = regex.compile &quot;(\\\\w+)&quot; -- prints: -- No No, No No, No No 6 print(r:gsub(s, &quot;No&quot;)) -- prints: -- $John $doe, $Jane $Doe, $Peter $Doe 6 print(r:gsub(s, &quot;($1)&quot;)) -- prints: -- john doe, jane doe, peter doe 6 print(r:gsub(s, &quot;\\\\l${1}&quot;)) -- prints: -- Matched =&gt; John Matched =&gt; doe, Matched =&gt; Jane Matched =&gt; Doe, Matched =&gt; Peter Matched =&gt; Doe 6 print(r:gsub(s, &quot;${1:+Matched =&gt; $1:No match.}&quot;))  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Build","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/setup/building","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Dependencies​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Build","url":"/docs/setup/building#dependencies","content":" The following libraries are required:  LuaJIT or Lua 5.4SDL2freetype2pcre2uchardet  If they are not installed on your system you can force meson to download and build them for you by using the following flag --wrap-mode=forcefallback.

Once Pragtical decides that a piece of text matches a pattern, it will assign that token type to it and move on. Patterns are tested in the order that they are written in the syntax definition, so the first match will win.  Patterns are based on Lua patterns or PCRE2.  You may find detailed information on Lua patterns in the [Lua Reference Manual]. For PCRE, there are various [regex tester websites] that provide documentation.  Lua patterns can be used by specifying pattern when defining a pattern, while PCRE can be used by specifying regex when defining a pattern.  Each pattern takes one of the following forms:  Simple Pattern​  { pattern = &quot;#.*\\n&quot;, type = &quot;comment&quot; },   When pattern is a string, Pragtical will test the input against the pattern. If the input matches, Pragtical will assign the given token type to the input.  In this case, any line starting with # will be assigned the type comment.  Start &amp; End Pattern​  { pattern = { &quot;%[&quot;, &quot;%]&quot; }, type = &quot;keyword&quot; },   When pattern is a table with 2 elements, Pragtical will use them to test for the start and the end of a range. Everything between the start and the end will be assigned the given token type.  In this case, everything between [ and ] will be assigned the type keyword.  However, it does not account for escape sequences. Inputs such as [\\]] will be interpreted wrongly as [\\] and ].  Start &amp; End Pattern with Escape​  { pattern = { '&quot;', '&quot;', '\\\\' }, type = &quot;string&quot; },   When pattern is a table with 3 elements, Pragtical will use the first two to test for the start and the end of a range. The last element is used to denote an &quot;escape sequence&quot;. If the text matches the 3rd element followed by the 2nd element, it will not be interpreted as the end of a range.  In this case, everything between &quot; and &quot; will be assigned the type string. A string can have escape sequences prefixed with \\.  Given the input &quot;\\&quot;Hello John\\&quot;&quot;, the entire input will be assigned the typestring.

The symbols section allows you to assign token types to particular keywords or strings - usually reserved words in the language you are highlighting. The token type in this section always take precedence over token types declared in patterns.  For example this highlights Host using the function token type,HostName as a keyword, yes, no, any and ask as a literal:  [&quot;Host&quot;] = &quot;function&quot;, [&quot;HostName&quot;] = &quot;keyword&quot;, [&quot;yes&quot;] = &quot;literal&quot;, [&quot;no&quot;] = &quot;literal&quot;, [&quot;any&quot;] = &quot;literal&quot;, [&quot;ask&quot;] = &quot;literal&quot;,   Tips: double-check your patterns!​  There are a few common mistakes that can be made when using the symbols table in conjunction with patterns.  Case 1: Spaces between two symbols tokens​  Let's have an example:  { pattern = &quot;[%a_][%w_]+%s+()[%a_][%w_]+&quot;, type = { &quot;keyword2&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot; } }   Let's explain the pattern a bit (omitting the empty parentheses):  [%a_] = any alphabet and underscore [%w_] = any alphabet, number and underscore %s = any whitespace character WORD = [%a_] followed by (1 or more [%w_]) pattern = WORD followed by (one or more %s) followed by WORD   Afterwards, you add an entry [&quot;my&quot;] = &quot;literal&quot; in the symbols table. You test the syntax with my functionand found that &quot;my&quot; isn't highlighted as literal. Why did that happen?  symbols table requires an exact match. If you look carefully, the empty parentheses (()) is placed after the space! This tells Pragtical that WORD followed by (one or more %s) is a token, which will match my (note the space in the match).  The fix is to add a normal token for the whitespace between the two tokens:  { pattern = &quot;[%a_][%w_]+()%s+()[%a_][%w_]+&quot;, type = { &quot;keyword2&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot; } }   Case 2: Patterns &amp; symbols tokens​  One might assume that Pragtical magically matches text against the symbols table. This is not the case.  In some languages, people may add a generic pattern to delegate the matching to the symbols table.  { pattern = &quot;[%a_][%w_]*&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot; }   However, the symbols table may look like this:  symbols = { [&quot;my-symbol&quot;] = &quot;function&quot;, [&quot;..something_else&quot;] = &quot;literal&quot; }   &quot;my-symbol contains a dash (-) and &quot;..something_else&quot; contains 2 dots (.). None of the characters are matched by [%a_][%w_]*!  Beware of the text you intend to match in the symbols table.If you want to use it, you need to ensure that it matches one of the patterns.  The correct patterns are:  { pattern = &quot;[%a_][%w%-_]*&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot; }, { pattern = &quot;%.%.[%a_][%w_]*&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot; },   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Testing Your New Syntax​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Syntaxes","url":"/docs/developer-guide/syntaxes-and-themes/creating-syntaxes#testing-your-new-syntax","content":" To test your new syntax highlighting you need to do two things:  Reload the Pragtical coreLoad a file in your chosen language and see how it looks  To reload the core, you can either restart Pragtical or reload it.

Everything drawn within the View dimension will be shown to the user, while everything drawn outside of the View are discarded. This ties into how Pragtical handles scrolling — the canvas is moved around instead of the stencil.  The size of a View (the stencil) is stored inView.size.x and View.size.y. These are the size of the stencil following our analogy. The size of the canvas is computed by callingView:get_scrollable_size() and View:get_h_scrollable_size(). These methods can return a value larger than the View size to enable scrolling or very huge numbers that represents an infinitely scrollable View.  The position of the View relative to the window is stored in View.position. Following our analogy, these values represent where to place the stencil. In reality, these values are rarely used directly as values returned by View:get_content_offset() is more useful.  If a View is scrollable, you should set View.scrollable to trueand override View:get_scrollable_size()and View:get_h_scrollable_size(). You should also call View:draw_scrollbar() in your draw method to render Pragtical's scrollbar for convenience.  When a View is scrollable, View:get_content_offset() can be used to determine where to start drawing. This method returns starting X and Y coordinates, which may be negative to represent hidden content above the View; or larger View size to represent hidden content after the View.  The scroll state of the View is stored in View.scroll. This table contains the X and Y offset when the view is scrolled. To simulate scrolling, you can change the value of View.scroll.to.x orView.scroll.to.y. A positive value will scroll right / down while a negative value scrolls left / up. Alternatively, you may change View.scroll.x or View.scroll.ydirectly.  In our example, we'll implement horizontal and vertical scrolling.

However, if you want to have more control over mouse events, you can override View:on_mouse_moved(), View:on_mouse_pressed(),View:on_mouse_released() and View:on_mouse_wheel().  function View:on_mouse_moved(x: number, y: number, dx: number, dy: number): boolean end function View:on_mouse_pressed(button: MouseButton, x: number, y: number, clicks: number): boolean end function View:on_mouse_released(button: MouseButton, x: number, y: number): nil end function View:on_mouse_wheel(y: number, x: number): boolean end   View:on_mouse_moved() accepts the X and Y coordinates of the mouse and the X and Y difference from the mouse's last position.  View:on_mouse_pressed() accepts the button pressed, the X and Y coordinates where the button is pressed and the number of clicks (from 1 to 3).  View:on_mouse_released() accepts the same arguments as View:on_mouse_pressed()except the number of clicks.  View:on_mouse_wheel() accepts the number of steps scrolled vertically and horizontally.  All of these methods except View:on_mouse_released() returns a boolean indicating that the event is handled.
