# Getting Started

Setting up Pragtical is easy.
Pragtical comes in `.zip` or `.tar.gz` packages and installers
depending on the platform.

## Install

Installing Pragtical is usually as simple as downloading the package and extracting it.
However, here are some platform-specific installation instructions.

- [Windows]
- [Linux]
- [macOS]

## Portable application

Pragtical stores user configuration in the OS-specific configuration directory.
This directory is also known as `USERDIR`.

These paths are checked to determine `USERDIR`:

1. `<directory_to_pragtical_binary>/user`
2. `$PRAGTICAL_USERDIR`
3. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pragtical`
4. `$HOME/.config/pragtical` or `$USERPROFILE/.config/pragtical` on Windows

In order to create a portable installation of Pragtical,
you can create a `user` directory where the executable resides.
Pragtical will then store configuration data in that directory.

## Plugins

Pragtical can be extended via plugins written in Lua.
In fact, most of Pragtical's features comes from plugins;
the core is kept simple and features are added via plugins
if possible.

Pragtical comes with a set of plugins and users can install more on their own.
Here are common plugins that most users install:
