# Classes and Objects

We've briefly talked about the class implementation used by Pragtical
in the introduction.
In this article, we'll talk about how to use the implementation
efficiently.

:::note
Some methods here will be written differently than in
the source code.
This is to clarify how the methods _should_ be called.
:::

## Creating classes

Similar to many other languages, all classes extend the `Object` class.
To extend a class, one can use the `Object.extend()` method.

```lua
function Object.extend(base_class: Object): Object end
```

This method accepts one parameter — the class to copy.
This method will create a copy of a `Object` that can
be extended without affecting the original object.

You can now define or override methods and metamethods of this
newly created class.
To initialize a class, you can override the `Object:new()` method.

```lua
-- load the Object class
local Object = require "core.object"
-- since the source class is usually the one you want to copy,
-- we often simplify it to Object:extend().
-- This is equivalent to Object.extend(Object).
local Animal = Object:extend()
-- define a constructor for Animal
function Animal:new()
  self.type = "animal"
end
```

:::tip
`Object` implements the `__tostring()` and `__call()` metamethods.
You can override the `__tostring()` metamethod to return a string
that suits your class.
:::

## Super class

You can access the super class via `Object.super`.
For instance, to call the constructor of the super class, you can do:

```lua
local Object = require "core.object"
local Animal = Object:extend()
function Animal:new()
  self.type = "animal"
end

local Dog = Animal:extend()
function Dog:new()
  -- call the superclass constructor
  -- note the use of . instead of : and explicitly passing self
  Dog.super.new(self)
end
```

Note that you must call super class methods with `.` instead of `:`
and pass `self` as the first parameter.
If you call the method with `:`, it will call the method with `self`
as `super`, which is **the super class** and not **the instance**.

## Class relationships

The `Object` class also provide utility methods for checking relations
between classes and object.

To check whether an object is strictly an instance of a class
(not an instance of a child class),
use `Object:is()`.
To do the inverse, use `Object:is_class_of()`.

```lua
function Object:is(class: Object): boolean end
function Object.is_class_of(class: Object, instance: Object): boolean end
```

`Object:is()` accepts a parameter — the class to compare it to.
If the object is strictly an instance of the class,
the method returns true.

`Object.is_class_of()` accepts a class and compares it against
an instance of an object.
If the object is a strictly an instance of the class,
the method returns true.

**Example:**

```lua
local Animal = Object:extend()
local Dog = Animal:extend()
local Cat = Animal:extend()
local doggo = Dog()

print(doggo:is(Dog)) -- prints true
print(doggo:is(Cat)) -- prints false
print(doggo:is(Animal)) -- also prints false

-- note that since we're going to pass Dog as the first parameter,
-- we might as well as use the colon notation
print(Dog:is_class_of(doggo)) -- prints true
print(Cat:is_class_of(doggo)) -- prints false
print(Animal:is_class_of(doggo)) -- prints false
```

To check whether an object is an instance of a class
(or an instance of child class), use `Object:extends()`.
To do the inverse, use `Object:is_extended_by()`.

```lua
function Object:extends(class: Object): boolean end
function Object.is_extended_by: Object, instance: Object): boolean end
```

The methods accept the same parameters as `Object:is()`
and `Object:is_class_of()`.

```lua
local Animal = Object:extend()
local Dog = Animal:extend()
local Cat = Animal:extend()
local doggo = Dog()

print(doggo:extends(Dog)) -- prints true
print(doggo:extends(Cat)) -- prints false
print(doggo:extends(Animal)) -- prints true

-- note that since we're going to pass Dog as the first parameter,
-- we might as well as use the colon notation
print(Dog:is_extended_by(doggo)) -- prints true
print(Cat:is_extended_by(doggo)) -- prints false
print(Animal:is_extended_by(doggo)) -- prints true
```
