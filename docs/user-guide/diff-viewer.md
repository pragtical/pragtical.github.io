# Diff Viewer

The Pragtical code editor includes a **Built-in Diff Viewer** designed to help
developers quickly visualize, navigate, and synchronize differences between
files or strings.

It is ideal for reviewing changes, understanding history, and synchronizing
edits, all without leaving Pragtical!

![Diff Viewer][1]

## Features

Whether you're comparing two strings, reviewing changes in a file, or
inspecting commit history via source control, the diff viewer provides a fast
and intuitive interface to understand code changes.

- **Side-by-Side Diff View**
  Visual comparison of two files, strings or combination of both with
  synchronized scrolling.

- **Effortless Navigation**
  Jump between differences using keyboard shortcuts or mouse navigation.

- **Line-Level and Inline Diffs**
  Highlights exact changes, whether it's an entire line or a single character.

- **Synchronize Differences**
  Merge changes across views or apply edits manually based on comparison.

- **Source Control Integration**
  Extended functionality when used with the built-in [Source Control Management]
  - Compare the current file to a previous version in your commit history.
  - View unstaged vs. working changes before committing.

- **Compare Any Input**
  Launch diffs between:
  - Project files
  - Snippets of code
  - Any file on your system

## Usage

There are different ways to open the Diff Viewer:

1. **From the Command Palette**:
   Press <kbd>ctrl+shift+p</kbd> and search for
   `diff-view:start-files-comparison` or `diff-view:start-strings-comparison`.

2. **Right-click the File Explorer (TreeView)**:
   In the explorer, right-click a file and select `Select for Compare`. Then
   right click another file and select `Compare with Selected`

3. **Right-click Selected Text**:
   In a document, right-click a text selection and select `Select Text for Compare`.
   Then right click another text selection and select `Compare Text with Selected`

4. **Source Control Manager**:
   With SCM installed, click on any changed file to compare it against the
   previous state, or navigate its commit history, right click any entry and
   select the `Compare with Current` option.

5. **API**:
   Plugins can programmatically launch the diff viewer using Pragticalâ€™s Lua API.

## Api Usage Example

You can easily compare any two open files. For example:

-- Files
diffview.file_to_file("src/old.ext", "src/new.ext")

-- Strings
diffview.string_to_string("some text", "some more text")

-- String / File
diffview.string_to_file("some text", "src/file.ext")

-- File / String
diffview.file_to_string("src/file.ext", "some text")
```
