Also, the code indentation logic was wrong on some instances and should behave better now thanks to Sentmoraap.  A bug on the tokenizer was fixed to prevent the premature end of child subsyntaxes. As a consequence, the python language syntax should behave better now, also this syntax saw some more adjustments. On the newly introduced Diff Viewer the gap differences between the two sides was not been accounted on scroll which caused out of sync scrolling, should be fixed now thanks tobananakid who reported the issue.

For PGO I introduced a lua stress script to generate the profiler data by running various tasks like: text editing, tokenizing, scale changes, rect drawing, multiple process launching, etc...  LuaJIT FFI is now been used to call into some of the most hot C functions used at runtime in order to reduce the calling overhead produced by the Lua C API by up to 90%.  Also, the node system was modified to only perform updates on active views and draw only the visible ones. This improves performance when having multiple documents open at once.  A performance regression that was introduced with the fonts defer bitmap feature was fixed thanks to reproducible test data provided by Amer. Pinpointing the issue took some profiling and analyzing but it was finally fixed resulting on snappier editor performance when opening files containing whitespace characters.  The config.fps flag is now better respected since the rendering system will not go much higher from the set value. Before, setting a value of 60 would not have much effect with total frames per second surpassing this value by the hundreds on forced redraws or received events, now, the max fps should be more aligned to the configured amount.

The program name and its arguments need not be escaped as the API does it when necessary.  Since v2.1.0, users can provide a string instead of a table as the first argument to prevent the function from escaping them. This may help with legacy software on Windows such as cmd.exe. However, this should not be done on POSIX platforms as the entire string will be treated as the program name and cause issues.  Before v2.1.0, this table is not escaped on Windows.  The second argument specifies options to control process creation.  timeout is an advisory value that will be used by process:wait() and is optional.  cwd is the current working directory of the program. If specified, the child process would run as if it was started in the directory.  stdin, stdout and stderr tells Pragtical how to treat standard input and output of the child process. There are four possible values:  process.REDIRECT_DEFAULT is the default behavior. It will be deprecated in future versions as specifying nil is preferred.process.REDIRECT_PIPE allows the Process API to write/read the input/output of the child process.process.REDIRECT_PARENT redirects the child process' input/output to the parent. If stdin has this value, child process will accept input from the parent process' console. If stdout or stderr has this value, child process will output to the parent process' console.process.REDIRECT_DISCARD discards any data to/from child process.process.REDIRECT_STDOUT can only be used on stderr and will redirect the child process' standard error to its standard output.  env is a table containing the environment variables for the child process as key-value pairs.  note On POSIX platforms, this table will extend the parent's environment. On Windows, this table will replace the parent's environment. In the future, this inconsistency may be fixed.  The function returns a Process object that the user should hold onto until the child process can be safely terminated. If the Process object is garbage-collected, the child process will be killed.

Once Pragtical decides that a piece of text matches a pattern, it will assign that token type to it and move on. Patterns are tested in the order that they are written in the syntax definition, so the first match will win.  Patterns are based on Lua patterns or PCRE2.  You may find detailed information on Lua patterns in the [Lua Reference Manual]. For PCRE, there are various [regex tester websites] that provide documentation.  Lua patterns can be used by specifying pattern when defining a pattern, while PCRE can be used by specifying regex when defining a pattern.  Each pattern takes one of the following forms:  Simple Pattern​  { pattern = &quot;#.*\\n&quot;, type = &quot;comment&quot; },   When pattern is a string, Pragtical will test the input against the pattern. If the input matches, Pragtical will assign the given token type to the input.  In this case, any line starting with # will be assigned the type comment.  Start &amp; End Pattern​  { pattern = { &quot;%[&quot;, &quot;%]&quot; }, type = &quot;keyword&quot; },   When pattern is a table with 2 elements, Pragtical will use them to test for the start and the end of a range. Everything between the start and the end will be assigned the given token type.  In this case, everything between [ and ] will be assigned the type keyword.  However, it does not account for escape sequences. Inputs such as [\\]] will be interpreted wrongly as [\\] and ].  Start &amp; End Pattern with Escape​  { pattern = { '&quot;', '&quot;', '\\\\' }, type = &quot;string&quot; },   When pattern is a table with 3 elements, Pragtical will use the first two to test for the start and the end of a range. The last element is used to denote an &quot;escape sequence&quot;. If the text matches the 3rd element followed by the 2nd element, it will not be interpreted as the end of a range.  In this case, everything between &quot; and &quot; will be assigned the type string. A string can have escape sequences prefixed with \\.  Given the input &quot;\\&quot;Hello John\\&quot;&quot;, the entire input will be assigned the typestring.

The symbols section allows you to assign token types to particular keywords or strings - usually reserved words in the language you are highlighting. The token type in this section always take precedence over token types declared in patterns.  For example this highlights Host using the function token type,HostName as a keyword, yes, no, any and ask as a literal:  [&quot;Host&quot;] = &quot;function&quot;, [&quot;HostName&quot;] = &quot;keyword&quot;, [&quot;yes&quot;] = &quot;literal&quot;, [&quot;no&quot;] = &quot;literal&quot;, [&quot;any&quot;] = &quot;literal&quot;, [&quot;ask&quot;] = &quot;literal&quot;,   Tips: double-check your patterns!​  There are a few common mistakes that can be made when using the symbols table in conjunction with patterns.  Case 1: Spaces between two symbols tokens​  Let's have an example:  { pattern = &quot;[%a_][%w_]+%s+()[%a_][%w_]+&quot;, type = { &quot;keyword2&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot; } }   Let's explain the pattern a bit (omitting the empty parentheses):  [%a_] = any alphabet and underscore [%w_] = any alphabet, number and underscore %s = any whitespace character WORD = [%a_] followed by (1 or more [%w_]) pattern = WORD followed by (one or more %s) followed by WORD   Afterwards, you add an entry [&quot;my&quot;] = &quot;literal&quot; in the symbols table. You test the syntax with my functionand found that &quot;my&quot; isn't highlighted as literal. Why did that happen?  symbols table requires an exact match. If you look carefully, the empty parentheses (()) is placed after the space! This tells Pragtical that WORD followed by (one or more %s) is a token, which will match my (note the space in the match).  The fix is to add a normal token for the whitespace between the two tokens:  { pattern = &quot;[%a_][%w_]+()%s+()[%a_][%w_]+&quot;, type = { &quot;keyword2&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot; } }   Case 2: Patterns &amp; symbols tokens​  One might assume that Pragtical magically matches text against the symbols table. This is not the case.  In some languages, people may add a generic pattern to delegate the matching to the symbols table.  { pattern = &quot;[%a_][%w_]*&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot; }   However, the symbols table may look like this:  symbols = { [&quot;my-symbol&quot;] = &quot;function&quot;, [&quot;..something_else&quot;] = &quot;literal&quot; }   &quot;my-symbol contains a dash (-) and &quot;..something_else&quot; contains 2 dots (.). None of the characters are matched by [%a_][%w_]*!  Beware of the text you intend to match in the symbols table.If you want to use it, you need to ensure that it matches one of the patterns.  The correct patterns are:  { pattern = &quot;[%a_][%w%-_]*&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot; }, { pattern = &quot;%.%.[%a_][%w_]*&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot; },   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Testing Your New Syntax​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Syntaxes","url":"/docs/developer-guide/syntaxes-and-themes/creating-syntaxes#testing-your-new-syntax","content":" To test your new syntax highlighting you need to do two things:  Reload the Pragtical coreLoad a file in your chosen language and see how it looks  To reload the core, you can either restart Pragtical or reload it.

Also having a LuaJIT first approach gives us FFI for free which allows easy interfacing with native C libraries for easier plugin development. LuaJIT has proven to be a mature Lua implementation that will provide a stable development ecosystem for the foreseeable future. Threading - a supported feature inside the core on components where it is practical to use, like file searching and replacing, where performance gains are evident. Improved Job Scheduling - internally the editor uses Lua coroutines to perform different types of task, the way these tasks are scheduled has been improved on Pragtical to provide better editor responsiveness.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"More Features​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Introduction","url":"/docs/intro#more-features","content":" Some of the additional features and enhancements include:  Widgets - more tightly integrated as part of the core for easier gui development and reusability, also ensuring that plugin developers can with more ease develop user interfaces when in need. Settings UI - if you are not using a terminal editor like n/vim it means you are looking for a more point and click approach which is why we include a graphical interface to adjust your preferences out of the box. But don't worry, configuring the editor through Lua will keep working because it is also pragtical 😉 Encoding - while UTF-8 has overtaken as the preferred encoding for text documents for its convenience, we can sometimes encounter a document in another encoding. Loading and saving documents with different encodings will be supported for when the need arrives, a feature that is also commonly found in other editors because it is pragtical. IPC - shared memory functionality is part of the core and IPC plugin shipped by default to allow opening files and tab dragging between currently opened instances. CLI - Integrated command line interface API that can be extended by plugins to provide new CLI flags. Search/Replace - Project-wide search and replace support, better user interface for both documents and project search/replace. Built-in Diff Viewer - A file or strings diff viewer that lets easily navigate and synchronize the differences. The functionality is expanded by the Source Control Management where it will let you compare your current checkout file to an older version on the commit history.

Everything drawn within the View dimension will be shown to the user, while everything drawn outside of the View are discarded. This ties into how Pragtical handles scrolling — the canvas is moved around instead of the stencil.  The size of a View (the stencil) is stored inView.size.x and View.size.y. These are the size of the stencil following our analogy. The size of the canvas is computed by callingView:get_scrollable_size() and View:get_h_scrollable_size(). These methods can return a value larger than the View size to enable scrolling or very huge numbers that represents an infinitely scrollable View.  The position of the View relative to the window is stored in View.position. Following our analogy, these values represent where to place the stencil. In reality, these values are rarely used directly as values returned by View:get_content_offset() is more useful.  If a View is scrollable, you should set View.scrollable to trueand override View:get_scrollable_size()and View:get_h_scrollable_size(). You should also call View:draw_scrollbar() in your draw method to render Pragtical's scrollbar for convenience.  When a View is scrollable, View:get_content_offset() can be used to determine where to start drawing. This method returns starting X and Y coordinates, which may be negative to represent hidden content above the View; or larger View size to represent hidden content after the View.  The scroll state of the View is stored in View.scroll. This table contains the X and Y offset when the view is scrolled. To simulate scrolling, you can change the value of View.scroll.to.x orView.scroll.to.y. A positive value will scroll right / down while a negative value scrolls left / up. Alternatively, you may change View.scroll.x or View.scroll.ydirectly.  In our example, we'll implement horizontal and vertical scrolling.

For plugins that comes in a folder, please consult specific instructions for each plugin. Historically, Pragtical does not enforce a specific file structure for these types of plugins. Old plugins may not have a init.lua file, which is used by Lua to find a plugin. In this case, you need to follow their install instructions.  ppmMiq To install a plugin with ppm, use ppm plugin install.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"PPM Installed from Scoop Fails to Install Plugins​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Plugins","url":"/docs/user-guide/plugins#ppm-installed-from-scoop-fails-to-install-plugins","content":" If you installed ppm and pragtical from Scoop and receive an error message when trying to install plugins, such as can't find dependency, it indicates that ppm was unable to locate the installation data files for pragtical.  Scoop adds the following directories to the environment variable PATH:  C:\\ProgramData\\scoop\\shims (for globally installed apps)C:\\Users\\&lt;YourUsername&gt;\\scoop\\shims (for user-installed apps)  It installs wrapper executables in these directories that redirect to the actual application installation paths, which can be:  C:\\ProgramData\\scoop\\apps\\pragtical\\current (globally installed)C:\\Users\\&lt;YourUsername&gt;\\scoop\\apps\\pragtical\\current (user installed)  This strategy of using redirector executable wrappers can cause the plugin manager to fail when searching for the data files. The pragtical.exeredirector binary located in C:\\ProgramData\\scoop\\shims orC:\\Users\\&lt;YourUsername&gt;\\scoop\\shims does not reside alongside the core Lua runtime files.  To successfully install plugins that have explicit dependencies on core plugins, you can use the --datadir option to specify the installation path ofpragtical data files. For example, to install lsp_quicklintjs, which depends on the core plugin language_js, you can run:  ppm install lsp_quicklintjs --datadir='C:\\ProgramData\\scoop\\apps\\pragtical\\current\\data'   Another workaround is to prepend C:\\ProgramData\\scoop\\apps\\pragtical\\currentor C:\\Users\\&lt;YourUsername&gt;\\scoop\\apps\\pragtical\\current to the PATH environment variable. This allows the plugin manager to properly locate the data directory, so you won't need to specify --datadir each time you call ppm. ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"}],"options":{"id":"default"}}
